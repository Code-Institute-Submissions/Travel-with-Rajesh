# Travel with Rajesh

:house: https://ceciliabinck.github.io/Travel-with-Rajesh/

Rajesh Timalsina is the owner of this business. We have been friend for about 7 years. I have heard him talk about how difficult it can be to get people to book with him and not one of the other companies. He has had the idea of making a website for a couple of years now but there was always something that got inbetween.

When I read about this project, the first thing I thought about was helping him. As this is my first project it will be a good basic website for him to start with. I want to help him to reach more people. He can use this page in combination with is other social media. To get it on to the internet with all the other companies. What makes his company special is the fact that it is still a small company, so he will guide you from the frist to the last step. 
I hope with making this website people will find him on there online search for a company to do some amazing activities in Nepal.

What I want to bring for the external users is a clear overview of all the different possible tours and trekking that his company offers. What they can expect on those tours and maybe even getting an idea of what the surrounding looks like with the photo gallery. With the different reviews I want to show them that this company will go the extra mile to give them a great trip and maybe even an once in a life time experience along the way. 

I wanted to keep the colors neutral because I did not want it to stand out to much against the different pictures that are on the site. i wanted to high light some pictures showing how amazing Nepal is. I also did not want it to be to busy to scare of some users.

I made it dropdown in the navbar to make it easier for users to find different sections on the trekking and tour page, the text on these pages can be a bit overwhelming especialy on the trekking page. There is a lot of information there. A colleauge told me all that white doesn't read very good. So I made some changes to the colours of the background as where it is easier to distinct the different region/sections on the page.


## UX

This website is for users that are intersted in traveling to Nepal. Whether it is for an adventures and active or a leisure holiday it is all possible in Nepal.

Users how are interested in an adventures or active holiday, can find different treks to do in Nepal. With every trek there is listed if it is an easy, medium or hard trek. They can also read in the discription what they can expect on the trek and there is even a link that will take them to the gallery page. On this gallery page they can see pictures of how that region looks like to get an better idea of what kind of view they can expect. 

The users how are interested in an more leisure


Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

### Design process

I have tried to us the website Mockbird, https://gomockingbird.com/home. To help me make the different frameworks for this page. I have to be honest I did not know how to use it. I was able to work some aspect of the site but not all. I had just had a meeting with Rajesh Timalsina and it was still fresh in my mind so I draw it on paper. I have incerted them in the repository in the folder mockups.

### Features

* Home page. On this home page users can find more information about the company and the people behind it. They can also find some reviews that people left after using the this company.
* Trekking, here users can find all the different trekking that this company offers.
* Tours, here users can find all the different tours that this campany offers.
* Photo gallery, to show users the beautiful surrounding and give them an idea of what they can see on the way.
* Contact Form, help them get in contact with the owner for information or book a tour.

### Existing Features

Feature 1 - Allows useres to get an idea of what kind of campany it is and what oter people think of the company and there staff.
Feature 2 and 3 - Will give users a better idea of the kind of possibilities there are for there holiday in Nepal. They can see if it suits there expectations on what they would want to do on there holiday, by reading the difficulty range.
Feature 4 - Allows users to get a sneakpeak in to the beautiful country and give them an idea of how the different regions look like.
Feature 5 - Allows users to get more information or book a tour/ trekking for there holiday. By having them fill out the contact form,which allows the company to give feedback back to them.

### Features Left to Implement

* A place to send the contact form to. I don't know yet how to link an email address to the contact form. So that when users fill out the contact form, they will get an suitable anwers back on their question or booking. 
* Also an message that tells users they have filled in the contact form correctly and that is has been send.
* A up button at the trekking page, to go to the top of the page again. A colleauge of mine suggested this to me because he found this as an user easier to go back to the top og the page, as to scroll all the way up again.
* When you click on the pictures that a pop up of the picture will appear. Als the pictures in the gallery appear quite small it would be nice that when users click on it, they will get an pop up of the picture in a bigger size. So they can have a better look.
* Put prices on the page. When users are looking for things to do on there holiday they would like to have an indication of what the cost would be, at least I would want to know. I have been told that because of the different factures during or preparing for the tour/trek can effect the price. So it makes it difficult to just pot down a price.

## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears, these messages appear in the language you have your device in.
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that it will go back to the contact form, this in chrome. When I tested it in Microsoft Edge and on a mobile device instead of going back to the contact form, it gives an 405 error.

I have 


In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

After I deployed my project I found out why you should not use capital letters in the name of your website. It makes it difficulter to find. I had someone look at my website and he typed everything in small letters en we got an error that it could not be found. I changed the capital letters to small letters and asked him again to look it up. But it did not make any differance. That was when I found out that I made this mistake.



This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

### Acknowledgements
* I would like to thank some of my colleagues for giving me suggestions on how to make this site more appealing for users.
* My mini projects that I have done. It gave me somthing to fall back on. I don't know if I could have done it if I didn't make those, How I made those is sometimes still a mistery to me.  
* I received inspiration for this project from my friend Rajesh Timalsina. He started his own company as a guide, to provide for his family and his future. He would be able to get a better income if he was his own boss then working for someone else. He found out that it was difficult to get jobs, even though he has his instagram and facbook page. I wanted to help him with getting, hopefuly, more known under all the tourist that go to Nepal every year to do trekking or tours through this beautiful country.
