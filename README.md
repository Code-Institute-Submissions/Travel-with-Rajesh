# Travel with Rajesh

:house: https://ceciliabinck.github.io/Travel-with-Rajesh/

Because this company is know on Facebook and Instagram under this name I did not change the name. It would have been strange if the website would have a different name then their Facebook and Instagram.

I want to help this company to reach more users. They can use this page in combination with their other social media. What makes this company special is the fact that it is still a small company, so they will guide you from the frist to the last step. I hope with making this website users will find them on there online search for a company to do some amazing activities in Nepal with.

What I want to bring for the external users is a clear overview of all the different possible tours and trekking that his company offers. What they can expect on those tours and maybe even getting an idea of what the surrounding looks like with the photo gallery. With the different reviews I want to show them that this company will go the extra mile to give them a great trip and maybe even an once in a life time experience along the way. 

I wanted to keep the colors neutral because I did not want it to stand out to much against the different pictures that are on the site. I wanted to high light some pictures showing how amazing Nepal is. I also did not want it to be to busy to scare of some users.

I made a dropdown in the navbar to make it easier for users to find different sections on the trekking and tour page, the text on these pages can be a bit overwhelming especialy on the trekking page. There is a lot of information there. A colleauge told me all that white doesn't read very good. So I made some changes to the colours of the background as where it is easier to distinct the different region/sections on the page.

I also heard they will modify a tour or a trekking to your needs, some want more comfort then others. I put that in h4 centered underneed the page as there wasn't really a good place any where else. I put a link next to al the trek and tour names with a star symble to link them to this information.

If you fill out the contact form correctly it will send you to the success.html, with the message that your message has been send to the company. As I am not sure yet how to make a alert that it has been send in a pop up.


## UX

This website is for users that are intersted in traveling to Nepal. Whether it is for an adventures and active or a leisure holiday it is all possible in Nepal.

Users how are interested in a holiday in Nepal, can find different treks to do in Nepal. With every trek there is listed if it is an easy, medium or hard trek. This is not specified with the tours because the are more of the easy kind.The tours can be modified them to make them easier or harder if the user would want to.
They can also read in the discription what they can expect on the trek and there is even a link that will take them to the gallery page. On this gallery page they can see pictures of how that region looks like to get an better idea of what kind of view they can expect. 

As a user type:
* I want to do a trek up to Mt. Everest, so that I can get it off my bucketlist.
* I want to see how people live in Nepal, so that i can learn more about the cultural differences in different countries.
* I want to see the highlights of Kathmandu, so that I can mark Nepal off my to go list.
* I want to see a rhino, so that I can tell everyone they live in more places then just Africa.
* I want to see kathmandu, so that I can find the best places to shop.

### Design process

I have tried to us the website Mockbird, https://gomockingbird.com/home. To help me make the different frameworks for this page. I have to be honest I did not know how to use it. I was able to work some aspect of the site but not all. I had just had a meeting with Rajesh Timalsina and it was still fresh in my mind so I draw it on paper. I have incerted them in the repository in the folder mockups.

### Features

* Home page. On this home page users can find more information about the company and the people behind it. They can also find some reviews that people left after using the this company.
* Trekking, here users can find all the different trekking that this company offers.
* Tours, here users can find all the different tours that this company offers.
* Photo gallery, to show users the beautiful surrounding and give them an idea of what they can see on the way.
* Contact Form, help them get in contact with the owner for information or book a tour.

### Existing Features

Feature 1 - Allows useres to get an idea of what kind of company it is and what oter people think of the company and there staff.
Feature 2 and 3 - Will give users a better idea of the kind of possibilities there are for there holiday in Nepal. They can see if it suits there expectations on what they would want to do on there holiday, by reading the difficulty range.
Feature 4 - Allows users to get a sneakpeak in to the beautiful country and give them an idea of how the different regions look like.
Feature 5 - Allows users to get more information or book a tour/ trekking for there holiday. By having them fill out the contact form,which allows the company to give feedback back to them.

### Features Left to Implement

* A place to send the contact form to. I don't know yet how to link an email address to the contact form. So that when users fill out the contact form, they will get an suitable anwers back on their question or booking. 
* Also an message that tells users they have filled in the contact form correctly and that is has been send.
* A up button at the trekking page, to go to the top of the page again. A colleauge of mine suggested this to me because he found this as an user easier to go back to the top og the page, as to scroll all the way up again.
* When you click on the pictures that a pop up of the picture will appear. Als the pictures in the gallery appear quite small it would be nice that when users click on it, they will get an pop up of the picture in a bigger size. So they can have a better look.
* Put prices on the page. When users are looking for things to do on there holiday they would like to have an indication of what the cost would be, at least I would want to know. I have been told that because of the different factures during or preparing for the tour/trek can effect the price. So it makes it difficult to just pot down a price.

## Testing

### User story

As a user type:
* I want to see how people live in Nepal, so that i can learn more about the cultural differences in different countries.
* I want to see the highlights of Kathmandu, so that I can mark Nepal off my to go list.
* I want to see a rhino, so that I can tell everyone they live in more places then just Africa.
* I want to see kathmandu, so that I can find the best places to shop.

The user how wants to trek to  Mt. Everest, the user will click on trekking in the navbar and then select Everest region then the user will see all the terkkings that are possible around Everest.

The user how want to do experience life in Nepal, the user will click on trekking in the navbar and then
This is more difficult to find because the trekkings are arraged on regions. Dhading region is the region Where the homstay is located under.

The user wants to do a tour, it will click on the tour page and then select which of the tours they are interested in. 

When the user has found they are interested in, the user will feel in the contact form as a first step to getting a tour made for them, in ther price range.
(In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:)

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears, these messages appear in the language you have your device in.

Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and for a while it would give and error message as there was no where to send or link to after submiting. I didn't think that was a very solution, as I don't know how to make it send just yet. So after thinking about it and asking people in slack i decided to make a separate page with the message that it has been send. 

So when you submit the form with all inputs valid it will verify this by sending the user to the success.html, with the message that the message has been send to the company. This works very good in chrome when in my viewer browser. Turnes out it dit not work when I used the official https. I have tested it on a mobile device and Microsoft Edge instead of going to the success.html, with the message that it is send to the company, it gives an 405 error.

I have not been able to get that bug out of it.

After looking for help in Slack and after Richard Wells saw the 405 error he did some research. He found out that the issue is pages hosted on github pages don't allow Post Method (taken from stackoverflow - GitHub pages can only serve static content, and there is no way to run PHP on GitHub pages or upload things. That's why GitHub doesn't allow POST requests. If you need server side scripting (E.g. PHP), you'll need to use a web host which offers these things.)

So after removing the Method="post". I tried to submit the form with all inputs valid and it verified it with showing the succes.html with the thanks you message.


(In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.)

## Deployment

I had worked with Cloud9 and Gitpod but for different reasons I decided not to use them. I made this project in Repl.it, I have to say it is easy to use. storing changes it GitHub is made very easy to. I choose Replit becaise it is easy to use, I don't have to worry about running out of credit and it is easy to see the result instead ofnin a little screen on the same page, to view it in a browser page. While I am working in Replit it automatically saves changes as I make them. 

The one thing I am not happy about with Repl.it is the fact that it just puts all the pages you have change under each other and you can only write one commit for all the pages you changed. This made it difficult with saving changes in GitHub, I have a lot commits that are longer or for 8 or so pages all the same.
Sometimes I worked on more then one page or I just keept working / changing things in different pages. I would be so focused that I forget to commit things in the order I would go. I know in Cloud9 and Gitpod that isn't any problem because you can just select the pages you want to commit to gether but in Replit that is not yet possible. That made for maybe a couple of strange commits. 

After I deployed my project I found out why you should not use capital letters in the name of your website. It makes it difficulter to find. I had someone look at my website and he typed everything in small letters en we got an error that it could not be found. I changed the capital letters to small letters and asked him again to look it up. But it did not make any differance. That was when I found out that I made this mistake.



(In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.)

### Acknowledgements
* I would like to thank some of my colleagues for giving me suggestions on how to make this site more appealing for users.
* My mini projects that I have done. It gave me somthing to fall back on. I don't know if I could have done it if I didn't make those, How I made those is sometimes still a mistery to me.  
* I would like thank the people on Slack that help me figure out issues that I had.
* I received inspiration for this project from my friend Rajesh Timalsina. He started his own company as a guide, to provide for his family and his future. He would be able to get a better income if he was his own boss then working for someone else. He found out that it was difficult to get jobs, even though he has his instagram and facbook page. I wanted to help him with getting, hopefuly, more known under all the tourist that go to Nepal every year to do trekking or tours through this beautiful country.
