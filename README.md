# Travel with Rajesh

:house: (put the link of the site here)

Rajesh Timalsina is the owner of this business. We have been friend for about 7 years. I have heard him talk about how difficult it can be to get people to book with him and not one of the other companies. He has had the idea of making a website for a couple of years now but there was always something that got inbetween.

When I read about this project, the first thing I thought about was helping him. As this is my first project it will be a good basic website for him to start with. I want to help him to reach more people. He can use this page in combination with is other social media. To get it on to the internet with all the other companies. What makes his company special is the fact that it is still a small company, so he will guide you from the frist to the last step. 
I hope with making this website people will find him on there online search for a company to do some amazing activities in Nepal.

What I want to bring for the external users is a clear overview of all the different possible tours and trekking that his company offers. What they can expect on those tours and maybe even getting an idea of what the surrounding looks like with the photo gallery. With the different reviews I want to show them that this company will go the extra mile to give them a great trip and maybe even an once in a life time experience along the way. 


## UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features
* Navbar, to help people navigate over the page better.
* Photo gallery, to show people the beautiful surrounding and give them an idea of what they can see on the way.
* Reviews, to show what people think about the company and tell there experiances with it. 
* Footer, as an extra uppertunity to get people to ask, look or give them more information.
* Contact Form, help them get in contact with the owner for information or book a tour.

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

### Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Technologies Used
(In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.)
### Languages

* HTML
* CSS
* Markdown

### Frameworks :page_facing_up:

I have tried to us the website Mockbird, https://gomockingbird.com/home. To help me make the different frameworks for this page. I have to be honest I did not know how to use it. I was able to work some aspect of the site but not all. I had just had a meeting with Rajesh Timalsina and it was still fresh in my mind so I draw it on paper. I have incerted them in the repository. 

### Libraries :books:

* W3school, https://www.w3schools.com/. For some extra help with Center Align Text and how to make my dropdown.
* Slack, thanks to Sean Murphy for helping me with my internal link.
* Bootsctrap, https://getbootstrap.com/
  I have used it to style:
  * Footer
  * Navbar
* Fontawsome, https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery
  I have used it to make the social media more visable.
* Webfx, https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/. to get some emoji's in my markdown.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

### Acknowledgements
I received inspiration for this project from my friend Rajesh Timalsina. He started his own company as a guide, to provide for his family and his future. He would be able to get a better income if he was his own boss then working for someone else. He found out that it was difficult to get jobs, even though he has his instagram and facbook page. I wanted to help him with getting, hopefuly, more known under all the tourist that go to Nepal every year to do trekking or tours through this beautiful country.
